# The Beginning
## The Journey of independence
### By Lawrence Marfo

Join me as I begin my journey into programming. 
This will be the start of something great with the hope of it eventually leading to a skill that makes us competitive.
I can only hope that I keep up with everything.

This is the plan for the trip

-[x]Matlab

-[ ]Python

-[ ]Javascript

I already have some experience with Matlab but I can expand more on the knowlege by having projects that interest me.
