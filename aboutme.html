                                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hi, my name is Lawrence Marfo. I am a recent graduate from James Madison University. I hold a Bachelor degree in Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. If the phrase <i>“wearing multiple hats”</i> needed a brand, I am certain that I would be the first on the list. My college career has exposed me to various projects and research that challenged my ideas on engineering. I found myself moving from creating instruments for children with disabilities to designing autonomous greenhouse for Mars. From creating human powered vehicles for the blind to analyzing the environmental impacts of fish farms, my experience has led me to stretch and expand my technical skills in ways I could never imagine.   
											If you ask me about my passion, you will get one word, <b>Coaching</b>. Specifically, bringing forth the different strengths that people have and aiming them towards all avenues of their lives. It is a skill that I developed while working at the university’s leadership center for the last six years.  My journey here enabled me to enact true change on the campus and in people’s lives. It is safe to say that helping others is the easiest way to learn about yourself.</p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>My strengths are mainly <em>people oriented</em>; it comes as no surprise that I find myself in the role of Team Leader in most of my projects. I find it easy to assign tasks where needed and place people in environments that make teams thrive (I am a better bonding agent than gorilla glue). I cannot stress the importance and effectiveness of having a common goal and mission in team setting. 
											These days, I am enjoying the development of my technical skillset. I have always been a great problem solver and I want to use this time away from school to add more tools into the toolbox.  During my time as an undergrad, I participated in several pop up hack-a-thons that tackled real world problems. It is here that I learned skills like creating a simulation for cell mechanics research using <b>python</b>, making visual representation of the data using <b>tableau</b> and PowerPoint, and formulating scientific data using <b>SPSS</b> and <b>Excel</b>.
											My end Goal is to be a life long learner. I look forward to sharing my journey with you. If you would like to get in touch with me and talk more, feel free to leave your information below.</p>
